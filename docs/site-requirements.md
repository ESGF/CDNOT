# Requirements from sites hosting CMIP data


ESGF consists of data infrastructure nodes of different complexity. In this document, two classes are distinguished: Tier-1 and 2 node sites. Tier 1 and Tier 2 nodes imply different requirements with respect to the ESGF infrastructure itself and with respect to ESGF data projects like CMIP6. The ESGF infrastructure requirements relate to node functionality, provided services and service levels in development, maintenance and operation. ESGF data project requirements focus more on physical infrastructure components adapted to the data project requirements.
In what follows, the requirements are formulated in more generic rather than concrete terms. In the case of CMIP6, data project node requirements for Tier 1 and Tier 2 sites contain concrete specifications as much as possible.

In addition to the ESGF Tiers, we identify a "Tier-3" for sites that make data available through means other than ESGF access.  An example of such a site
